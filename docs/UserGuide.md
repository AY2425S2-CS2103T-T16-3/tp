***QuickHire*** is a desktop address book application designed for recruiters to manage and organise the details of their potential job candidates.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T16-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your ***QuickHire*** application.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar quickhire.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 j/Software Engineer l/Unreviewed` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [General command format](#general-command-format) below for details of each command.

<a href="#quickhire-user-guide" class="ug-nav-top">[Go to top]</a>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General command format

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Some commands have items **starting with** `/` (e.g., `/a`, `/f`, etc.). They are to be specified as they are without any parameters.
  e.g. `save c/candidates.json /f`

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Saving the data : `save`

Changes to data (pertaining to candidates and interview schedules) are automatically saved by ***QuickHire*** (see [Editing the data file](#editing-the-data-file)).
However, users can choose to save this data to a separate file of their choice (i.e., by using this command).

<box type="tip">

The application needs to have sufficient permissions to write to the file(s) specified in order for the `save` feature to work.

</box>

Format: `save [c/FILE_TO_SAVE_CANDIDATES] [s/FILE_TO_SAVE_INTERVIEW_SCHEDULES] [/a] [/f]`

* Saves data pertaining to candidates into the file referred by `FILE_TO_SAVE_CANDIDATES`
* Saves data pertaining to interview schedules into the file referred by `FILE_TO_SAVE_INTERVIEW_SCHEDULES`
* At least one of `[c/FILE_TO_SAVE_CANDIDATES]` or `[s/FILE_TO_SAVE_INTERVIEW_SCHEDULES]` must be specified. It is also okay to specify both.
* By default, if a filter was applied to the data (e.g., using `find`), then _only the filtered data_ will be saved.
* (Optional) Specify `/a` to save all ***QuickHire*** data (instead of just the filtered ones).
* By default, if the file(s) specified already exists, then no data will be overwritten to those file(s).
* (Optional) Specify `/f` to overwrite the contents of the file specified

Examples:
* `save c/past_candidates.json` Saves the filtered data of candidates to `[JAR file location]/past_candidates.json` (if it does not exist).
* `save /a c//all_candidates.json` Saves the data of all candidates in the application to `/all_candidates.json` (Note the additional `/` after `c/`).
* `save c/existing_file.json /a /f` Saves the data of all candidates in the application to `[JAR file location]/exiting_file.json` and overwrites any existing data in the file.
* `save s/interview_schedule.json` Saves the (filtered) interview schedules to `[JAR file location]/interview_schedule.json` (if it does not exist).
* `save c/candidates_details.json s/interview_details.json` Saves the filtered data of candidates and (filtered) interview schedules to `[JAR file location]/past_candidates.json` and `[JAR file location]/interview_schedule.json` respectively (if they do not exist).

<a href="#quickhire-user-guide" class="ug-nav-top">[Go to top]</a>

## Viewing job application statistics: 'viewstats'

Displays the number of applications for each job role.

Format: `viewstats`

<a href="#quickhire-user-guide" class="ug-nav-top">[Go to top]</a>

## Changing the theme : `theme`

Changes the theme of the UI.

Format: `theme dark/light`

* You may change the theme using the above command or the GUI.
* Your theme will be saved the next time you re-open the application as well.

<a href="#quickhire-user-guide" class="ug-nav-top">[Go to top]</a>

## Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

<a href="#quickhire-user-guide" class="ug-nav-top">[Go to top]</a>

## Editing the data file

Data pertaining to candidates and interview schedules are saved automatically into two JSON files: `[JAR file location]/data/candidates_list.json` and `[JAR file location]/data/scheduleboard.json` respectively.
Advanced users are welcome to update these data directly by editing those data files.

<box type="warning">

**Caution:**

If your changes to the data files makes their format invalid, ***QuickHire*** will discard all data and start with empty data files at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the files before editing it.
This can be done by either copying the two files mentioned, or by using the `save` command (See [Saving the data : `save`](#saving-the-data--save)).<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause ***QuickHire*** to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range).
Therefore, edit the data files only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: What if the same person applies to the same company a few months later?<br>
**A**: There are 2 options:
1. Edit the person's existing entry with the updated details; or
1. Delete the old entry, and re-add the complete and updated details of the person (should there be any clashes in data)

**Q**: What if the person wants to apply for multiple roles within the same company? <br>
**A**: Multiple job roles can be added using the edit command.

**Q**: I have details of 37 candidates saved in the app. But when I run `save`, the file only has details of 2 candidates. Why is this so? <br>
**A**: Probably the `save` command was executed without any optional flags. To be able to save all data, you have 2 options:
1. (Easiest) Use the optional `/a` flag of `save` command to save all candidates' information.<br>
   E.g., `save c/file_to_save.json /a`
1. Run `list` in the app to ensure the app no filtered is applied to the candidates' data. Then run the `save` command as usual.

**Q**: I want to save the data of candidates and interview schedules. I want to overwrite any existing data I have of candidates, but I don't want to overwrite any existing data pertaining to interview schedules. What should I do? <br>
**A**: Save both data separately using two commands (instead of one) like so:
1. Save **only** the data of candidates first, specifying the `/f` flag to overwrite any existing data.<br>
   E.g., `save c/candidates_as_of_24_July.json /f`
1. Then, save the data on interview schedules separately, but **without** the `/f` flag.<br>
   E.g., `save s/interview_schedules`

**Q**: I have saved some data of potential candidates in a JSON file and I would like to import it into the application. What should I do?<br>
**A**: As of `v1.5.1`, ***QuickHire*** doesn't support importing data files from within the application. However, there is a workaround. To import the data, perform the following steps:
1. (Optional, but recommended) Make a copy of the data file you have (so that you have a backup copy in case the data gets corrupted).
1. Close ***QuickHire***.
1. Rename the file you wish to import as either `[JAR file location]/data/candidates_list.json` or `[JAR file location]/data/scheduleboard.json`.<br>
   In this case, you want to rename it as `[JAR file location]/data/candidates_list.json` since you are importing data of potential candidates.
1. Launch ***QuickHire*** again. If everything went well, you should be able to view the data from the file you imported in the application.<br>

<box type="warning">
   
**Caution**

Note that when you import data this way, you will only see the data from the newly imported file, and ***the data from the old file will be removed***.
If you wish to keep the old data file as well, create a separate backup of it (as mentioned under [Editing the data file](#editing-the-data-file)).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
1. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
